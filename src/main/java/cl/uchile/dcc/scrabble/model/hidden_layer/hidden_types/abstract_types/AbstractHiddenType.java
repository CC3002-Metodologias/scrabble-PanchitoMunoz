    /**
     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning of "copy" may depend on the
     * class of the object. The general intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
     * will be true, and that the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements. While it is typically the case
     * that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling {@code super.clone}.  If a
     * class and all of its superclasses (except {@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be
     * the case that {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of this object (which
     * is being cloned).  To achieve this independence, it may be necessary to modify one or more
     * fields of the object returned by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this
     * means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure" of the object
     * being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies.  If
     * a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone} need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a specific cloning operation.
     * First, if the class of this object does not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to
     * implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that the return type of the {@code clone}
     * method of an array type {@code T[]} is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive
     * type. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and
     * initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this
     * object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this
     * method performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, so
     * calling the {@code clone} method on an object whose class is {@code Object} will result in
     * throwing an exception at run time.
     *
     * @return a clone of this instance.
     * @see Cloneable
